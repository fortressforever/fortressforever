DONE: Fix tools for HL2/TF2 coordinate space
DONE: Load textures from Half-Life .WADs
DONE: Write out Q2 texture format (not miptex)
DONE: Write test map viewer
DONE: Test detail brushes
DONE: view portals to test
NOT DOING:Write out HL style collision trees
DONE: new engine loader
DONE: new vis in HL2 engine - looks simple now
DONE: Do QRAD backwards? i.e. use Valve QRAD, and merge in the Q2 file formats?  probably
DONE: Integrate Ken's qrad code into qrad3
DONE: add area portal visibility to HL2 engine
DONE: write area portal entities for HL2/TF2
DONE: test area portal code
Split clusters for outdoor vis

QBSP3 Chop is based on recursive subdivision.  
 - Force natural alignment of some sort to eliminate slivers where brushes meet ?


Use Q2 style ladder indicator? yes
Use Q2 style friction indicator? probably or not if physics based

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NOTE: set DISP_PROTO to compile with displacement map info -- not on by default until
      the prototype is done, the checked in .exe does not have displacement map functionality
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

DONE: put DISP_PROTO defines around all of the displacement code until prototyping is done
DONE: add displacement map structure
DONE: add displacement face structure
DONE: change face/side structures to accept displacement texinfo and displacement face indices
DONE: change .map loader to parse displacment map info
DONE: don't allow merge or subdivision of displacement faces
DONE: when splitting brushes, the new generated side get initialized to -1
DONE: add find displacement face functionality, then create it if not found
DONE: add find displacement map functionality, then create it if not found
DONE: initialize the displacement data before loading the .map file
initialize the face data with dispface and dispmap = -1, is this necessary????
DONE: copy from bsp tool face to bsp file face -- the displacement info
DONE: add/copy lumps
DONE: swap data for writing to bsp -- not really necessary, but to keep in sync with the rest
DONE: write .bsp data out
DONE: add displacement data to .bsp statistics -- print file

Test maps:
DONE: map where disp face gets split by block node
DONE: map where disp face attempts merge/split
DONE: map with texture disp face
DONE: map with lots of disp faces
DONE: map with multiple disp faces referencing one map
DONE: map with multiple disp faces on one brush
DONE: map with multiple disp faces on one brush referencing one map
DONE: map with funky texture split encased on one portal
